/*
1. Brute force double for loop will check all combinations even if there are duplicates  TC O(m *n)
2. Two pointer approach where low is start of one array and high is at end of another array , can skip duplicate distances
3. hashing will not work , because the sum is not fixed 
4. Binary search will have TC O(m logn)
